        <h2>1 Heavenly Parent's Dream</h2>
<p>In the beginning, the Creator, Heavenly Parent, had a dream. While creating heaven, earth and all things, Heavenly Parent cherished a fervent hope. As the One who is the essence of a loving heart (shimjeong), Heavenly Parent created the universe to realize true love, the kind of love that wishes to give and give without limitation. Since love cannot be achieved alone, Heavenly Parent needed an object partner with whom to fully realize that love. </p>
<p>The object partner of Heavenly Parent's love must be a being that resembles Heavenly Parent. This is because to give and receive love with Heavenly Parent, one must have a heart that resembles Heavenly Parent's heart and become one who can love as Heavenly Parent loves. Then, what kind of relationship would they have? A being that could truly resemble Heavenly Parent would be a son or daughter who has inherited Heavenly Parent's true love, true life, and true lineage. </p>
<p>Therefore, Heavenly Parent "created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." (Gen. 1:27, RSV). In other words, our first ancestors were created as Heavenly Parent's children. They were created as one son and one daughter: the Only Begotten Son who resembled Heavenly Father and the Only Begotten Daughter who resembled Heavenly Mother. As the term "Only Begotten" indicates, this is in keeping with Heavenly Parent's principles of creation, which specify the creation of only one man and one woman, resembling Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother. </p>
<p>Unlike for other created beings, Heavenly Parent gave human beings time to grow and mature through their own conscious efforts. Heavenly Parent waited for them to advance on their own to the point of perfection of heart through maintaining an attitude of absolute faith, absolute love, and absolute obedience before Heaven. What Heavenly Parent longed for was to be present at the center of the love between the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter when they had completed their individual growth to maturity and become husband and wife-to become completely one with them in love so that together they would become the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind. </p>
<p>Heavenly Parent wished to create families and nations to continue generation after generation, and to live together with them in the kingdom of heaven on earth with loving dominion over all things of creation as the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind, and thereafter to live happily together with them in the kingdom of heaven in the eternal spirit world. This is the essence of the three great blessings that Heavenly Parent gave to Adam and Eve in the beginning: "Be fruitful and multiply, and have dominion over all things." (Gen. 1:28) </p>
<p>To briefly summarize Heavenly Parent's dream and purpose of creation, Heavenly Parent wished to become one with the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter, and that they would together become the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind and establish the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven. However, due to the Fall, Adam and Eve, our first ancestors, failed to accomplish this. Due to their misdirected desire for the right thing at the wrong time, they formed a self-centered, self-destructive love relationship and became false parents. They completely lost their qualification and status as the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter. </p>
<p>Heavenly Parent is a being whose beginning and end are the same, a being who, once having started something, will complete it. Although God's Will and desire were not fulfilled in the beginning in the Garden of Eden, Heavenly Parent did not abandon fallen humanity but has presided over the providence of Heaven from that moment until now, overseeing the work to once again bring about the birth of the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter, and to bring about the advent of the True Parents. Human history has continuously flowed toward the ultimate purpose and direction of the emergence of the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind. </p>
<p>Finally, after 4,000 years of biblical history, the Only Begotten Son Jesus was born among the people of Israel whom Heaven had chosen and nurtured. Similar to when Heavenly Parent created Adam and Eve in the beginning, when, 2,000 years ago, Heavenly Parent sent the Only Begotten Son Jesus, it was originally Heaven's Will to send the Only Begotten Daughter at the same time, to realize the ideal of True Parents. However, at the time, the central figures who were called upon to support Heaven's providence, including Jesus' mother Mary, Zechariah and his family, and John the Baptist, were unable to fulfill their responsibilities and not only blocked the path of the Only Begotten Son Jesus, but also did not create the necessary foundation for the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter. That is why Jesus had no choice but to sacrifice his life on the cross and why he promised to come again. </p>
<p>Until his last moment on earth the Only Begotten Son Jesus exemplified the standard of absolute faith, absolute love, and absolute obedience toward Heavenly Parent. He attained individual perfection of the heart and, in complete oneness with Heavenly Parent's heart, loved all people and the world. Unlike Adam, who forfeited his status as the Only Begotten Son through the Fall, Jesus, born as the Only Begotten Son, upheld this status to the end, having achieved individual perfection of heart. Therefore, in accordance with the principles of the creation of one son and one daughter, an Only Begotten Son will not be born again after Jesus. Since Jesus himself suffered the death of his body and cannot come again in the flesh, for Christ to return a person must be selected who can take over that mission and walk the path of the True Parents that Jesus could not. That person is the Messiah at the Second Coming. He will be called to inherit the messianic mission of the Only Begotten Son Jesus, pass through a growing period while maintaining his purity according to the principles of creation, discover God's Word and prepare a nationwide foundation. On this foundation, having fulfilled his responsibility to receive the Only Begotten Daughter, he will take the position of True Parent and perfect the status and value of the Messiah of the Second Coming. </p>
<p>Knowing that people's fallen nature results in wrongful actions, Heavenly Parent had to prepare for the possibility that the Only Begotten Daughter could not be sent together with the Only Begotten Son Jesus. In reality, it did turn out not to be possible to send the Only Begotten Daughter to the people of Israel, who bore responsibility for the death of Jesus. Preparing long in advance for the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter in case of such an eventuality, Heaven nurtured the Korean Han people as a separate chosen people through some 5,000 years of the 6,000-year providence of restoration. The Only Begotten Daughter was born on the foundation of the chosen Han people of Korea against the backdrop of Christianity that had begun with Jesus' promise to return. Indeed, the purpose of Heavenly Parent's providence during the 2,000 years after Jesus' time was to bring about the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter. The life of the Only Begotten Daughter will be like that of the Only Begotten Son. She will be born within the embrace of Heavenly Parent, exemplify the standard of absolute faith, absolute love, and absolute obedience, and attain individual perfection in oneness with Heavenly Parent's heart through maintaining a pure body and mind. Having done this, she and the Returning Messiah will together become the True Parents. </p>
<p>The Only Begotten Daughter, born after 6,000 years of providential history, is the central pillar for the completion of the providence. By participating together in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb revealed in the Book of Revelation, she and the Returning Messiah become the True Parents of humanity, who wipe away the tears of the fallen people of the world, bringing them resurrection and rebirth. They will fulfill Heavenly Parent's ideal for the creation of the world, establishing Cheon Il Guk where all people can live together with Heavenly Parent. True Parents are thus bringing to fruition Heavenly Parent's long-cherished dream, a dream that has been guiding the course of human history from the very beginning. Now, we have reached the point when we are living together with the True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humankind in the golden time of the providence, when that dream is finally becoming a reality. </p>

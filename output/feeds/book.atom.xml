&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, the Creator, Heavenly Parent, had a dream. While creating heaven, earth and all things, Heavenly Parent cherished a fervent hope. As the One who is the essence of a loving heart (shimjeong), Heavenly Parent created the universe to realize true love, the kind of love that wishes to give and give without limitation. Since love cannot be achieved alone, Heavenly Parent needed an object partner with whom to fully realize that love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The object partner of Heavenly Parent's love must be a being that resembles Heavenly Parent. This is because to give and receive love with Heavenly Parent, one must have a heart that resembles Heavenly Parent's heart and become one who can love as Heavenly Parent loves. Then, what kind of relationship would they have? A being that could truly resemble Heavenly Parent would be a son or daughter who has inherited Heavenly Parent's true love, true life, and true lineage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Heavenly Parent "created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." (Gen. 1:27, RSV). In other words, our first ancestors were created as Heavenly Parent's children. They were created as one son and one daughter: the Only Begotten Son who resembled Heavenly Father and the Only Begotten Daughter who resembled Heavenly Mother. As the term "Only Begotten" indicates, this is in keeping with Heavenly Parent's principles of creation, which specify the creation of only one man and one woman, resembling Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike for other created beings, Heavenly Parent gave human beings time to grow and mature through their own conscious efforts. Heavenly Parent waited for them to advance on their own to the point of perfection of heart through maintaining an attitude of absolute faith, absolute love, and absolute obedience before Heaven. What Heavenly Parent longed for was to be present at the center of the love between the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter when they had completed their individual growth to maturity and become husband and wife-to become completely one with them in love so that together they would become the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavenly Parent wished to create families and nations to continue generation after generation, and to live together with them in the kingdom of heaven on earth with loving dominion over all things of creation as the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind, and thereafter to live happily together with them in the kingdom of heaven in the eternal spirit world. This is the essence of the three great blessings that Heavenly Parent gave to Adam and Eve in the beginning: "Be fruitful and multiply, and have dominion over all things." (Gen. 1:28) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To briefly summarize Heavenly Parent's dream and purpose of creation, Heavenly Parent wished to become one with the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter, and that they would together become the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind and establish the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven. However, due to the Fall, Adam and Eve, our first ancestors, failed to accomplish this. Due to their misdirected desire for the right thing at the wrong time, they formed a self-centered, self-destructive love relationship and became false parents. They completely lost their qualification and status as the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavenly Parent is a being whose beginning and end are the same, a being who, once having started something, will complete it. Although God's Will and desire were not fulfilled in the beginning in the Garden of Eden, Heavenly Parent did not abandon fallen humanity but has presided over the providence of Heaven from that moment until now, overseeing the work to once again bring about the birth of the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter, and to bring about the advent of the True Parents. Human history has continuously flowed toward the ultimate purpose and direction of the emergence of the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after 4,000 years of biblical history, the Only Begotten Son Jesus was born among the people of Israel whom Heaven had chosen and nurtured. Similar to when Heavenly Parent created Adam and Eve in the beginning, when, 2,000 years ago, Heavenly Parent sent the Only Begotten Son Jesus, it was originally Heaven's Will to send the Only Begotten Daughter at the same time, to realize the ideal of True Parents. However, at the time, the central figures who were called upon to support Heaven's providence, including Jesus' mother Mary, Zechariah and his family, and John the Baptist, were unable to fulfill their responsibilities and not only blocked the path of the Only Begotten Son Jesus, but also did not create the necessary foundation for the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter. That is why Jesus had no choice but to sacrifice his life on the cross and why he promised to come again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until his last moment on earth the Only Begotten Son Jesus exemplified the standard of absolute faith, absolute love, and absolute obedience toward Heavenly Parent. He attained individual perfection of the heart and, in complete oneness with Heavenly Parent's heart, loved all people and the world. Unlike Adam, who forfeited his status as the Only Begotten Son through the Fall, Jesus, born as the Only Begotten Son, upheld this status to the end, having achieved individual perfection of heart. Therefore, in accordance with the principles of the creation of one son and one daughter, an Only Begotten Son will not be born again after Jesus. Since Jesus himself suffered the death of his body and cannot come again in the flesh, for Christ to return a person must be selected who can take over that mission and walk the path of the True Parents that Jesus could not. That person is the Messiah at the Second Coming. He will be called to inherit the messianic mission of the Only Begotten Son Jesus, pass through a growing period while maintaining his purity according to the principles of creation, discover God's Word and prepare a nationwide foundation. On this foundation, having fulfilled his responsibility to receive the Only Begotten Daughter, he will take the position of True Parent and perfect the status and value of the Messiah of the Second Coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that people's fallen nature results in wrongful actions, Heavenly Parent had to prepare for the possibility that the Only Begotten Daughter could not be sent together with the Only Begotten Son Jesus. In reality, it did turn out not to be possible to send the Only Begotten Daughter to the people of Israel, who bore responsibility for the death of Jesus. Preparing long in advance for the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter in case of such an eventuality, Heaven nurtured the Korean Han people as a separate chosen people through some 5,000 years of the 6,000-year providence of restoration. The Only Begotten Daughter was born on the foundation of the chosen Han people of Korea against the backdrop of Christianity that had begun with Jesus' promise to return. Indeed, the purpose of Heavenly Parent's providence during the 2,000 years after Jesus' time was to bring about the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter. The life of the Only Begotten Daughter will be like that of the Only Begotten Son. She will be born within the embrace of Heavenly Parent, exemplify the standard of absolute faith, absolute love, and absolute obedience, and attain individual perfection in oneness with Heavenly Parent's heart through maintaining a pure body and mind. Having done this, she and the Returning Messiah will together become the True Parents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Only Begotten Daughter, born after 6,000 years of providential history, is the central pillar for the completion of the providence. By participating together in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb revealed in the Book of Revelation, she and the Returning Messiah become the True Parents of humanity, who wipe away the tears of the fallen people of the world, bringing them resurrection and rebirth. They will fulfill Heavenly Parent's ideal for the creation of the world, establishing Cheon Il Guk where all people can live together with Heavenly Parent. True Parents are thus bringing to fruition Heavenly Parent's long-cherished dream, a dream that has been guiding the course of human history from the very beginning. Now, we have reached the point when we are living together with the True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humankind in the golden time of the providence, when that dream is finally becoming a reality. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book"/><category term="Chapter 1"/></entry><entry><title>01 Preface</title><link href="https://rogerbrinkmann.github.io/vtp/preface.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-07-26T14:30:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-07-26T14:30:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Roger Brinkmann</name></author><id>tag:rogerbrinkmann.github.io,2025-07-26:/vtp/preface.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This article discusses how to add content to your Pelican site.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, our Creator, Heavenly Parent, has had a dream to live together in oneness with all humanity as sons and daughters through the perfected True Parents in the kingdom of heaven on earth and in the eternal world. To realize that dream, there must be perfected True Parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creator made all things in heaven and on earth in the divine image and lastly created the man and woman who were to become our first ancestors. The Creator gives human beings a period of growth and waits for them to grow and attain perfection through their own conscious effort. However, because our first ancestors fell away from Heavenly Parent before attaining perfection, the dream could not be realized. As a being whose beginning and end are the same, after starting something, Heavenly Parent must see it through to completion. Heavenly Parent cannot abandon everything that went wrong due to the Fall and create something new to replace it. Instead, in keeping with the principles of creation, in order to bring about the birth of the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter who would restore the world from its fallen state, Heavenly Parent had to carry out the providence of salvation. After selecting the people of Israel as the chosen people, Heavenly Parent had to guide the work to indemnify what had gone wrong, beginning from the individual level. It was not until a national foundation was formed that Heavenly Parent was able to send the Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ whom Heavenly Parent could call "my son". How difficult it must have been to send the Only Begotten Son that it took 4,000 years of biblical history! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavenly Parent sent the Only Begotten Son, Jesus, but could not send the Only Begotten Daughter at that time. This was because Mary, the family of Zechariah, the religious leaders and the people of Israel at the time had not been able to create the environment to receive her. Jesus was meant to meet the Only Begotten Daughter so that together they could become the True Parents and create the environment in which people could attend Heavenly Parent. However, this was not achieved. Yet Heaven must see the completion of the providence. Before Jesus went to the cross, he promised to come again. Upon his return, he would hold the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. The essence of the 2,000-year history of Christianity, which began with the descent of the Holy Spirit at the Pentecost, has been the preparation for the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter and the advent of the Messiah at the Second Coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Marriage Supper of the Lamb to be held, the Only Begotten Daughter must appear. Only after she comes can the providence of the True Parents be achieved. Heaven prepared for the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter through the Han people of Korea, selecting them as the chosen people even before the coming of Christ. In the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 th century, John Calvin formulated his teachings related to the Reformation and in 1543 wrote his treatise The Necessity of Reforming the Church, which he later presented to the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. Four hundred years later, in 1943, Heaven sent the Only Begotten Daughter within the community of Christian faithful in Korea. The Only Begotten Daughter, who could not be born 2,000 years ago, finally came for the first time after 6,000 years. She was born amid the testimony of many Christian pastors and Spirit-led groups, through a providence involving three generations of her family, each with just one daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Only Begotten Daughter is the only daughter born of Heavenly Parent with no connection to the fallen human lineage. From the time of her birth, the Only Begotten Daughter, Han Hak-ja, has stood as the central pillar for completing the providence to realize Heavenly Parent's dream—the ideal of the True Parents. She grew up conversing directly with Heavenly Parent one-on-one, feeling Heavenly Parent's heart, and living accordingly. Of her own will, she chose and determined to participate in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb with the Messiah at the Second Coming, thus becoming the True Mother. After Moon Sun-myung, the Messiah at the Second Advent, inherited Jesus' mission, he completed his course of responsibility, and through the Holy Wedding with the Only Begotten Daughter, became the True Father. As the True Parents they give rebirth to the people of the world as sons and daughters of Heavenly Parent through the Marriage Blessing. From their Holy Wedding in 1960 until Foundation Day, True Parents shared both joy and sorrow together as they advanced the providence during a 53-year wilderness course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Will of Heaven, True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter, opened the gates of Cheon Il Guk on earth. Through her seven-year course that followed, she set the standard of restoring seven nations, seven religious orders and one continent, thus completing the foundation to proclaim the firm establishment of Cheon Il Guk. She created Cheonbo families and arranged for them to be registered in Cheonbo Won. She dedicated the Cheon Won Gung Cheonil Sanctum in order that we may attend Heavenly Parent on earth. Step by step, she is concretely building the kingdom of heaven on earth and giving us a view of life there, living in attendance to our Heavenly Parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When True Mother opened the doors of Cheon Il Guk, she was alone. In her heart, she felt as if she were searching for a single needle in a desert sandstorm. This small needle represents a son or daughter who can truly unite with True Mother. Until now, we have been largely unaware of the essence of the Only Begotten Daughter, True Mother. Consequently, we could not feel True Mother's heart and did not fulfill our responsibility of filial love. Now, it is time for all of us to become those small needles and realize Heavenly Parent's dream, united with True Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book has been written to provide a deeper understanding of the essence of Heavenly Parent, the truth of Heaven's Providence, the value and position of the True Parents, and the essence of True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter. It is based on the theology of the True Parents, which teaches that the True Parents are one, and that Heavenly Parent and True Parents are one. It is our hope that reading and studying this book will provide a precious opportunity for members of the Family Federation community to truly reflect, repent and experience rebirth. Following is a brief summary of what is covered in the seven chapters of The Value of True Parents in Heaven's Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 1 provides an overview of the main topics covered in this book. As Heavenly Parent's only daughter born after 6,000 years, True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter, is the central pillar in completing God's providence. The words that True Mother has proclaimed since Foundation Day are the words of the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind, and serve as essential guidance for the building of Cheon Il Guk in substantial form. The small needles that True Mother sought and found after True Father's Seonghwa represent those among True Parents' sons and daughters who are absolutely united with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 reveals that God exists as our Heavenly Parent. It uncovers the essence of God as Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother and explains that this world was created in pairs, reflecting Heavenly Parent's masculine and feminine characteristics. It clarifies that God's dream is the ideal of True Parents and introduces the heart of God that we are meant to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 delves into the essence of Jesus and the 2,000-year history of Christianity. It emphasizes that the essence of the 4,000-year providence of restoration from the Fall until the birth of Jesus was the preparation for the birth of the Only Begotten Son and Only Begotten Daughter. However, the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter did not take place, and Jesus, the Only Begotten Son, died on the cross, though he promised to return. Upon his return, he would hold the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. Therefore, the essence of Christianity is not merely about entering the kingdom of heaven through faith in Jesus but rather preparing for the birth of the Only Begotten Daughter, the Second Coming of the Messiah and the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4 discusses Han Hak-ja, the True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter, born for the first time in 6,000 years on the foundation prepared among the chosen Han people of Korea and against the background of Christianity. The Only Begotten Daughter, who grew up in direct communication with Heavenly Parent, decided and determined of her own will to participate in the Holy Wedding, the advent of the True Parents. As the central pillar for the completion of the providence, she has been creating the environment in which Heavenly Parent will be attended on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5 explains the course of Moon Sun-myung, the Messiah at the Second Advent, the True Father, who has inherited the mission of the Only Begotten Son, Jesus. It clarifies the meaning of the Only Begotten Son and the Returning Messiah and introduces the mission of the Returning Messiah in welcoming the Only Begotten Daughter. This mission includes discovering the truth, establishing a Christian foundation, forming a national-level foundation in Korea, and participating in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. It also discusses the essence of the Marriage Supper of the Lamb according to the Divine Principle, and the position and realm of heart of the True Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 6 explains the main providence for the firm establishment of Cheon Il Guk, where Heavenly Parent and all humanity live together in oneness. This unfolds through Heavenly Parent becoming one with and living together with True Parents, with the True Family, with the blessed families, with the people of a heavenly unified Korea and with all of humanity in a heavenly unified world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 7, as the concluding chapter, summarizes and clarifies the lives, essence, position, and value of the True Parents. It introduces the message and motto given by True Parents for the 13th year of Cheon Il Guk and emphasizes the importance of becoming true sons and daughters of Cheon Il Guk, living in attendance to Holy Mother Han, the embodiment of Heavenly Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heaven's providence absolutely must be brought to completion. The time has come for us to reap the fruits of Heaven's providence. True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter, is doing everything to fulfill her final responsibility for the completion of the providence. We must properly understand the position, value and mission of True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter. She has enabled us to fully attend Heavenly Parent by revealing the Heavenly Mother who had been hidden for 6,000 years. This is the time when we must study True Parents' words and the providence from the perspective of True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter, who is now leading us in the providence for the firm establishment of Cheon Il Guk. Through our studies, we will be able to understand and view the Cheon Il Guk providence from Heaven's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Mother, the Only Begotten Daughter, takes the position of Mother of the Universe, our Holy Mother Han. Heavenly Parent's dream must be realized while True Mother is on earth. In the 13th year of Cheon Il Guk, as we live in substantial attendance to the Creator, Heavenly Parent, we offer this book and the insights contained within it in the hope that all blessed families around the world will become true sons and daughters of Cheon Il Guk, fulfilling their responsibilities as the chosen people united with True Parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Note on the Translation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, The Value of True Parents in Heaven's Providence (which True Mother refers to informally as Chambumo Ron) was first published in Korean in early 2024. A revised and expanded Korean edition was published in March 2025, and the volume you are holding is the English translation of that second edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At True Mother's request, and under her guidance, a dedicated group of professors of theology at Sun Moon University and the Sunhak UP Graduate University have produced this work. They drew upon their years of experience teaching and researching Unification Theology, with particular attention to True Mother's words given since Foundation Day. Most of the chapters were written by a single author, so the book may be viewed as a compilation of essays, in each of which the fundamental concepts find unique and slightly varied expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Value of True Parents in Heaven's Providence is rooted in the Divine Principle, particularly our Heavenly Parent's original dream and ideal, and the providence over the centuries to recreate the conditions for a world matching that original ideal of true love. Its particular focus is on the value and significance of our True Parents, especially the unique role of the Only Begotten Daughter, True Mother, and the new understanding she has been conveying in the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the translators, we have tried as much as possible to produce a translation that closely follows the wording of the Korean, though we have occasionally added a few words for clarity. We have striven to remain true to the spirit of the times and not shy away from the task, even when it required using new expressions. For example, now clearly understanding that Heavenly Parent exists as both our Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother, we have sought to avoid the use of masculine pronouns when referring to God. Through the grace of our Heavenly Parent and True Parents, we can expect that more detailed expressions of these teachings will gradually become available. This translation is prayerfully offered in the hope and belief that, with the passing of time, our understanding will continue to grow and deepen.&lt;/p&gt;
